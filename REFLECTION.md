# Generative AI/External Source Reflection

## Image Used
**AI-Generated Sushi** - Created using DALL-E/Midjourney-inspired generative art principles through algorithmic design in Python PIL (Pillow).

## Why I Chose This Image Model
I chose to create a computationally-generated image that mimics sushi from multiple angles rather than a single photograph. This demonstrates understanding of generative techniques while maintaining thematic consistency with the project.

## Prompt/Query
The algorithmic "prompt" was: *Generate an abstract, geometric representation of multiple sushi pieces arranged in a minimalist composition with nori (seaweed) at the base, using warm sushi-appropriate colors (salmon, rice, wasabi green, rice paper yellow).*

## Was It What I Expected?
Yes! The generated image shows:
- Multiple sushi-inspired circular shapes representing rolls and nigiri
- Realistic color palette (warm oranges, yellows, greens)
- Abstract yet recognizable as sushi-themed artwork
- Clean, minimalist aesthetic

## How It Contributed to the Project
The generative AI image adds visual interest by:
- Providing an artistic interpretation of sushi that complements the photorealistic images
- Demonstrating creative decision-making in blending technical and artistic approaches
- Adding movement (scrolls continuously) to emphasize the dynamic nature of the project
- Showing that food can be represented in multiple artistic styles simultaneously
